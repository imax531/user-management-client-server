Applicants will have to create a basic CRUD app with authentication, authorization and roles.
On the backend expect an express server with mongo DB.
The front will include a React app.

There will be two roles: admin, user.
Admin can add, edit and delete users.
Users can only view other users.

Front will have:
Login page
User CRUD page

Adhere to best practices as much as you can. Use whatever necessary tools and libraries to accomplish this. It’s not expected of you to build the webpages from scratch; the use of component libraries is encouraged.

Using typescript, adding validations, using state management, checking login state etc. Is not required but any addition to the basic task will be an appreciated bonus.

It would be very helpful if the exercise will be presented in a git repo, it doesn’t have to be uploaded anywhere, but it would give indication to the applicant’s work through his different commits.
